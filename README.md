# Weather App

This app displays a live 5 day weather forecast.

Built using React, this project has taught me a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- JSX
- Props
- State
- Stateful components
- Stateless components
- React Hooks
- React Testing Library
- Request/Response

## Installation
